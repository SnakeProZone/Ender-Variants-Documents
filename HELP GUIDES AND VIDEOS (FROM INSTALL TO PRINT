CALIBRATION TEST
  Do you find yourself not getting parts to fit properly, coming out too small too large. 
  Well fret no more, here is a test that can assist with that and main other things if you know what to look for.
  https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3707798. 
  
  I would add the context of the test here... buuuuutttttt... it is quite long and details every part of the test 
  and certain design aspects of the test. So again follow the link to the test. not for those who want to rush everything 
  with a fast or small test print of whatever. Greatness comes with time and hard work, kind of like this test model. 
  ain here is the link. https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3707798
  
  Cleaning and Preventive Maintenance Checks (CPMC)

I will not get deep into every detail on how, what, when and why to clean certain things, or why it is done that way. 
Check the links for cleaning tips/ methods.

How to Unclog a 3D Printer Nozzle

Ultimaker has a great walkthrough of nearly the whole printer being cleaned (It is one of their in the example)

So there are way too many resources for me to sit here and list them all out. So let get specific to the Ender 3 
and variants.

Check for loose filament debris. Being that we use v-slots and wheels, filament can and get caught up in the extrusions 
and cause issues with the machines movement, mostly affecting surface quality, layers shifts etc. From time to time look 
between the grooves and the wheels of your machine. Move the X and Y planes back and forth/ side to side when steppers 
are disabled and feel for any abnormal feel to the movement. If it isn't a smooth ride from end to end, there is 
something amiss. Either debris or a bad wheel.

I prefer to clean my nozzle after every print. I even go as far as to wipe the nozzle with acetone while preheated, to 
remove any unseen filament that could cause more to stick to it. (I rarely have anything stick to the nozzle, as 
depicted in almost all my photo where the nozzle is present.)

Clean your friggin bed surface.

If you use tape, replace when it first rips, the integrity is compromised and may rip more when removing a print 
(I have used tape and I don't recommend it due to the hassles that come along.)

Glass beds: depending on your choice of adhesive, it can vary how to clean. IPA (90% +) is a must, it's great at 
getting rid of dirt and grease and giving a very clean surface.

Those with hairspray/ glue/ abs juice etc. on glass... eehhhh depending on how often you print and apply a light dusting 
of the bed before or after prints.... I recommend cleaning it every 2 weeks, or when prints start to leave impression 
on the beds surface.

Glass w/ PEI: I say clean every few prints with IPA, then once every 1-2 weeks you clean with acetone.
DO NOT GLASS THE ACETONE DIRECTLY ON THE PEI, IT WILL DEGRADE THE SURFACE AND RUIN IT.

Clean you fans. It could be just my printer’s location, but I see more dust on those fans than I do anywhere else. Either 
way clean, dust builds up, particles drop off and get on the print the bed other places etc. I recommend IPA and cotton 
swabs, q-tips, etc.

Clean your extruder and gear. We should all know why this needs to be done. Use a small tooth brush of sorts and 
compressed air, clean to gear blow it out.

Like I said this is a lot more to "CPMC" of your machines, but this is a good start. Check this guide out for a fix 
regarding cleaning the z axis lead screw below in the user fixes section (photos on this guide as well.

Got bored and looked around on Facebook at the official Ender 3 group, and found something, IMO, that many of you could/ 
should take a look at this as well.

Enjoy the loooooooong read. (See attached PDF) Full disclosure TL/DR

So I thought I would add a pretty good assembly video, which I followed and have had none of the common little issues. 
This along with some of the other links below have help me and others. So check it out if you haven't yet.

ADVANCED BED LEVELING
I recommend this to anyone who has had or has issues with the bed getting leveled or is just plain tired for 
leveling at any time. I personally do not believe in ABL devices, they are Band-Aids to the actual issue. 
If you haven't heard of it or just have not cared to do this next step you should. 
*https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3415460 and pair it with this to complete the conversion 
https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3193722.**

After these changes were made on my E3's or my other printer formerly known as an A8(still have just not used and
halfway disassembled), I have what I like to call walk away printers. I press print and walk away, without fear 
of a bad first layer. Check on the printer after a few minutes, if I'm still around, and if all looks good 
(whether still on the first layer or not) I let it rock-out.

derWaldschrat provided this information here regarding bed leveling. So if some of you cannot get a good bed level 
no matter what they do, check the following link. It is well documented, short, clear and concise, and well presented 
and delivered. https://docs.google.com/document/d/10vsq-cN722SfCyX4edZYfuxIOAc-E5zJBaB7jsbepQI

the second link is specifically for the Ender 3. I have done this on both my E3's, I use double thumb-wheels with nyloc 
nuts and no springs. I have added a link for a printed thumbwheel with a captive nut for stiffer leveling wheels that 
do not spin off own their own printing. Here they are https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3638778

FOR PRINTING ON BLUE TAPE TIPS
Now the following information is a little dated, albeit a few years old it is still very valid and well explained, 
more so than some guides with more recent information as most are just recycled or copy pasted… (I will probably 
catch shit for this) but like all3dp, where for articles are links and such from other sites and guides JUST LIKE 
THE ONE YOU ARE READING!!!!

This is the link to the whole site http://www.desiquintans.com/3dplog/ and I added the direct links to specific 
information that should be looked into for advice OR issue resolutions.
