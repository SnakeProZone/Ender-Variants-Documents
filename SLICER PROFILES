CURA
So a few of us in the group have tested and adjusted a Cura profile (specific to the Ender 3 (E3), provided by @Ender3Guy. 
I have taken the liberty of editing the profile for my printer 
(see my printer setup in the "User Fixes" section at the bottom)

I have since made my own profiles and have added them to the Files Section of the guide.

Simplified 3D (S3D)
Thanks to @darcdrake for a very good S3D setting config file. As not many people have S3D, so this is great to have here 
with the community. Hope you all enjoy. Linked photos of models printed with this profile.
